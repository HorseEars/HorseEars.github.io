I have been meaning to update my personal website for a while. The old website was created completely from scratch many years ago to give myself a chance to improve my web development skills and try some HTML5 features. Over time this lead to me ignoring the website as more and more work was needed. I decided to finally give Jekyll a chance as it is fully supported by github pages. It felt a little unnecessary and more work than just building something from scratch, but after a few quick guides everything is working well.

I am hoping to use this to post semi-regularly with examples from projects I have created, project showcases, and quirks I find along the way. We'll see if that *actually* happens.
